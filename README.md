## Hi, this is Boris :v:

I am a researcher in the field of aerospace engineering and involved in many free time side projects. 

I am interested in:
- mathematical methodologies to *describe* :black_nib: (system identification, model-order-reduction, etc.)
- mathematical methodologies to *simulate* :computer: (numerical solvers of differential equations and simulation tools)
- mathematical methodologies to *manipulate* :arrows_clockwise: (optimal control theory, robust control, etc.)

Check out my [research profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris-Micheli) and feel free to reach me at boris.micheli29@gmail.com

Thank you for visiting !
